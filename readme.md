Infer the content-type of a HTTP Header for Deno, compatible with Browser. Based
on `https://github.com/jshttp/type-is`.

## API

```js
import { hasBody, is, typeofrequest } from "https://deno.land/x/type_is/mod.ts";
```

### is(mediaType: string, types?: string[]): boolean | string

Checks if the `mediaType` is one of the `types`. If the `mediaType` is invalid
or does not matches any of the `types`, then `false` is returned. Otherwise, a
string of the type that matched is returned.

The `mediaType` argument is expected to be a
[media type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838) string. The `types` argument
is an array of type strings.

Each type in the `types` array can be one of the following:

- A file extension name such as `json`. This name will be returned if matched.
- A mime type such as `application/json`.
- A mime type with a wildcard such as `*/*` or `*/json` or `application/*`. The
  full mime type will be returned if matched.
- A suffix such as `+json`. This can be combined with a wildcard such as
  `*/vnd+json` or `application/*+json`. The full mime type will be returned if
  matched.

Some examples to illustrate the inputs and returned value:

```js
const mediaType = "application/json";

is(mediaType, ["json"]); // => 'json'
is(mediaType, ["html", "json"]); // => 'json'
is(mediaType, ["application/*"]); // => 'application/json'
is(mediaType, ["application/json"]); // => 'application/json'

is(mediaType, ["html"]); // => false
```

### typeofrequest(header: Headers, types?: string[]): null | boolean | string

Checks if the `header` is one of the `types`. If the header's request has no
body, even if there is a `Content-Type` header, then `null` is returned. If the
`Content-Type` header is invalid or does not matches any of the `types`, then
`false` is returned. Otherwise, a string of the type that matched is returned.

The `header` argument is expected to be a Deno's Headers, it should be
compatible with browser's Headers as well. The `types` argument is an array of
type strings.

Each type in the `types` array can be one of the following:

- A file extension name such as `json`. This name will be returned if matched.
- A mime type such as `application/json`.
- A mime type with a wildcard such as `*/*` or `*/json` or `application/*`. The
  full mime type will be returned if matched.
- A suffix such as `+json`. This can be combined with a wildcard such as
  `*/vnd+json` or `application/*+json`. The full mime type will be returned if
  matched.

Some examples to illustrate the inputs and returned value:

```js
const header = new Headers([["content-type", "application/json"]]);

typeis(header, ["json"]); // => "json"
typeis(header, ["html", "json"]); // => "json"
typeis(header, ["application/*"]); // => "application/json"
typeis(header, ["application/json"]); // => "application/json"
typeis(header, ["html"]); // => false
```

Example in Deno http server:

```js
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts";
import { typeofrequest } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ako-deno/type_is/master/mod.ts";

const server = serve("127.0.0.1:4500");

for await (const req of server) {
  const isText = typeofrequest(req.headers, ["text/*"]);
  const res = {
    body: `you ${istext ? "sent" : "did not send"} me text`,
    headers: new Headers(),
  };
  req.respond(res).catch(() => {});
}
```

### hasBody(header: Headers): boolean

Returns a Boolean if the given header's `request` has a body, regardless of the
`Content-Type` header.

Having a body has no relation to how large the body is (it may be 0 bytes). This
is similar to how file existence works. If a body does exist, then this
indicates that there is data to read from the Deno's request stream.
